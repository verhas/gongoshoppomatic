# Persistence File

Persistence implementation for the GonGo that stores the ACL data in plain files. This
impementation is for experimental, PoC and toy and development purposes. Commercial applications
should use an implementation that persistes data in some more robust way, like in SQL or
NonSQL databases, Hadoop file system etc.
