  reviewsText: '"I would actually give these 4 1/2 stars if I could. These are the
    best headphones I have ever heard from B&W, greatly improved from their closed
    in, overly warm earlier models. The P7 wireless still have a somewhat elevated
    bass, but control and slam in the bass region is excellent and the elevated bass
    does not muddy the excellent midrange. Highs are very good also. Imaging not a
    pinpoint as the Sennheiser Momentum wireless, but also very good. Superior bluetooth
    range, and interference when it does occur is not as ""busy"" as on the Momentums
    - instead of a series of dropouts and digi-noise as on the Senns, I usually only
    get a simple dropout of signal - much less annoying. Everything is improved a
    bit in wired mode, the bass is even better controlled, making them less warm while
    improving slam even more, midrange & highs also improve. Best ear pads ever -
    very deep and the foam forms a nice seal which is very effective for blocking
    outside noise (there is no Noise Cancelling in these as in the Momentums). Clamping
    force is very strong at first (which helps with the seal) which may be off-putting
    to some. These are excellent headphones, especially for Bluetooth headphones,
    but I find the Momentums a tad more refined and prefer them slightly to the P7.
    However, they are close enough in quality that it is a matter of taste I think,
    and many will prefer the B&W - you can''t go wrong either way."', reviewsTitle: excellent
