  reviewsText: '"I bought this obviously to watch my pets. One of them has been digging
    at some trim and I wanted to see who it was. I have witnessed the culprit and
    am able to talk with her to get her to stop. I have been using for 2 weeks now,
    almost daily. When I go to work is my main concern, but have tried even while
    out shopping, dining etc. The picture has always been crystal clear, however,
    it does switch between black and white and color. Not sure why but it''s not a
    major issue for me. You can can hear them or mute them, speak with them, check
    on the room temperature, it has night vision that works in the complete darkness
    and still get a nice picture. They also will save the recordings for you for a
    small fee. They give 7 days free. My only dissatisfaction with this product is
    that you cannot raise the volume on the camera itself and I feel it''s a little
    on the low side. I do know the dogs can hear me when I speak to them. There are
    2 holes in the bottom to mount, but the way I would really like to mount it turns
    the camera upside down and the picture stays that way, it won''t right itself.
    I''m satisfied with this little camera and has done what I need it to do. When
    I have to be away from the pups I can still check in on them and talk with them.
    It has actually put me at ease and given me a little peace of mind. I can see
    that they are doing well, have water, they are playing and most importantly that
    they are safe and peaceful. My boss made a good point today as well. The direction
    the camera faces happens to be my front door, so I can see if anyone breaks in
    or if there should be a fire or some dangerous situation, I will know in real
    time."', reviewsTitle: A decent video camera for the price., reviewsUsername: CherylM,
